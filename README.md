A Tribute to AIDE and a New Beginning

It is with sadness that the Android developer community received the news of the apparent discontinuation of AIDE, an innovative integrated development environment (IDE) that allowed creating applications directly on mobile devices. AIDE won many hearts with its practicality, powerful features, and intuitive interface, becoming an essential tool for many.
Faced with the absence of updates and the silence of the original developers, the community found itself orphaned from a beloved tool. But the passion for AIDE and the need for a similar solution remain. It is in this context that AIDE-Unofficial emerges.
